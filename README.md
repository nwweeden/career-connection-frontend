# Career Connetion Front End
 - Deployed: [Career Connection](http://career-connection.demo.nickweeden.com/)

## About the Application

This is the front end of a job board application. With the back end, there are a variety of features:

 - Users can login or sign up and their information is saved via authentication
 - Users can search for specific companies or jobs
 - Users can apply to certain jobs - no request built in, but this action is maintained between sessions
 - Users can update their information
 - All information and actions are collected and saved on the back end (created with Heroku)

## State
- State is mostly used to store information on the current user of the application - primarily managed through context

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd film-finder-frontend`
3. `npm install` to install dependencies
4. `npm start` to launch the application
5. `npm test` to run tests

This repository is a Create-React-App for the front end. Clone with the back end to have a fully functioning app.

Have Fun!
